I am super excited after finding out about HackClub Highway to Undercity! I have been dreaming about building an e-skateboard for agesss but couldn't because of funding. Anyways, today we will begin proper research, getting down parts needed and how to build. (Also having ideas of a "smart" e-skateboard)
